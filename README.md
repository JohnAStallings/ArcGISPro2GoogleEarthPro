To start tracking press the start button, to stop tracking press the stop button. It is that simple.
If you pan/zoom in Google Earth, it will NOT pan/zoom in ArcGIS Pro however, when you pan/zoom again in ArcGIS Pro Google Earth will resume tracking your movements. If you accidently close Google Earth while this tool is tracking you do not panic, the tool will automatically re-open Google Earth.


There are a few settings in Google Earth that you will want to set before use.
